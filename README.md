# Student-sos
Student-SOS is a web-based emergency item borrowing system designed for college campuses. It enables students to post urgent requests for essential items such as calculators, chargers, or stationery during time-sensitive situations like exams or practicals. Other students can accept and fulfill these requests through a structured workflow.
